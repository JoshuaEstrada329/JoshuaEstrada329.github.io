# Welcome to my GitHub Page

Hello! My name is Joshua Estrada. I am currently a Davenport University student working on my bachelor's in Computer Information Systems. I have been programming for about 4 years now since high school. I really enjoy breaking problems down and solving and putting together the solutions. Currently, I have only worked on really small projects at home that take on already solved problems in the world. I have programmed in C#, Java, and C++ but am always open to learn different languages and programming techniques. My goal in life is to become a Software Developer and to create software that can help people's lives become easier or better.

## Purpose
The purpose of this page is to become a hub for all my projects that I belive showcase my abilities as a programmer as well as give a little background history of me as a person and programmer. This page was created using Jekyll themes and is hosted by Github Pages
